# get-first-url-from-string

This util expects a string of text, it will return the 1st https URL is finds in the string and return it.

If no URL is found it will simply return and empty string.

No dependencies, see an improvement on the regex pattern, PRs are welcomed :)

For examples, please see the unit tests.
